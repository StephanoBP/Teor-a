Greeting to whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received on 27/01/2023. Despite the high cost of your products, the customer service I received was unacceptable.

On 20/01/2023, I purchased a television from your store, located at Av.Monforte de Lemos 36,Madrid. When I brought the product home, I discovered that it was defective. I immediately contacted your customer service department, 
but the representative I spoke with was unhelpful and dismissive. They refused to offer a refund or exchange and told me that I would have to contact the manufacturer directly.

I was extremely disappointed with the way my complaint was handled. I have been a loyal customer of your company for many years, and I expect a higher level of customer service. 
I expect that you will take immediate action to rectify the situation and ensure that your representatives are trained to handle customer complaints in a more professional and efficient manner.

If not I would not come again to your store and change my technologycal supplier.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Stephano Burgos.
