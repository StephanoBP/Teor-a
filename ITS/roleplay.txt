1-Hi I have a problem with the Internet.
2-Tell me what happened.
1-Well since this morning I couldn't enter to any webpage.
2-Do you mean that you cant use the net properly because the Internet went off. 
2-Have I understood that correctly?
1-Yes, can you help me with that please?
2-The way you've described this, I can see why you are unhappy.
2-I'll look into this and get back to you as soon as possible.
